# Spring Framework: XML Implementation

This is a repository for a Java project that used Spring Framework. In this project I implemented XML configuration, which is an Inverse of Control implementation on Spring.
This was done for assignment of Framework-based Programming course.

Here are several useful links to use Spring Framework
The Eclipse-based IDE for Spring Framework (no need to install it!)
  - https://spring.io/tools

The mandatory library to use Java:

And the library (the actual framework):
